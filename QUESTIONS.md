Potential questions to pursue with this model could include:

1. what the future/past would look like if we used thermostable vaccines (but why would we need those?)
2. Vaccine equity: 
	a. consequence of receiving vaccines too late in the pandemic 
	b. Should some countries have all they need while others have basically nothing versus receiving proportional amounts worldwide
